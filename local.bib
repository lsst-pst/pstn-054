abstractNote = {To optimize the observing strategy of a large survey such as the LSST, one needs an accurate model of the night sky emission spectrum across a range of atmospheric conditions and from the near-UV to the near-IR. We have used the ESO SkyCalc Sky Model Calculator to construct a library of template spectra for the Chilean night sky. The ESO model includes emission from the upper and lower atmosphere, scattered starlight, scattered moonlight, and zodiacal light. We have then extended the ESO templates with an empirical fit to the twilight sky emission as measured by a Canon all-sky camera installed at the LSST site. With the ESO templates and our twilight model we can quickly interpolate to any arbitrary sky position and date and return the full sky spectrum or surface brightness magnitudes in the LSST filter system. Comparing our model to all-sky observations, we find typical residual RMS values of ±0.2-0.3 magnitudes per square arcsecond.},

	abstract = {We use SDSS imaging data in the ugriz passbands to study the shape of the point-spread function (PSF) profile and the variation of its width with wavelength and time. We find that the PSF profile is well described by theoretical predictions based on von KÃ¡rmÃ¡nâs turbulence theory. The observed PSF radial profile can be parameterized by only two parameters, the profileâs full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a normalization of the contribution of an empirically determined âinstrumentalâ PSF. The profile shape is very similar to the âdouble Gaussian plus power-law wingâ decomposition used by the SDSS image-processing pipeline, but here it is successfully modeled with two free model parameters, rather than six as in the SDSS pipeline. The FWHM variation with wavelength follows the Î» Î± power law, where Î±Â âÂ â0.3 and is correlated with the FWHM itself. The observed behavior is much better described by von KÃ¡rmÃ¡nâs turbulence theory, with the outer-scale parameter in the range of 5â100 m, than by Kolmogorovâs turbulence theory. We also measure the temporal and angular structure functions for FWHM and compare them to simulations and results from the literature. The angular structure function saturates at scales beyond 05â10. The power spectrum of the temporal behavior is found to be broadly consistent with a damped random-walk model with a characteristic timescale in the range of âŒ5â30 minutes, though the data show a shallower high-frequency behavior. The latter is well fit by a single power law with an index in the range of â1.5 to â1.0. A hybrid model is likely needed to fully capture both the low-frequency and high-frequency behavior of the temporal variations of atmospheric seeing.}
