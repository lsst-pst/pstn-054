	journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
	abstract = {We use SDSS imaging data in the ugriz passbands to study the shape of the point-spread function (PSF) profile and the variation of its width with wavelength and time. We find that the PSF profile is well described by theoretical predictions based on von KÃ¡rmÃ¡nâs turbulence theory. The observed PSF radial profile can be parameterized by only two parameters, the profileâs full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a normalization of the contribution of an empirically determined âinstrumentalâ PSF. The profile shape is very similar to the âdouble Gaussian plus power-law wingâ decomposition used by the SDSS image-processing pipeline, but here it is successfully modeled with two free model parameters, rather than six as in the SDSS pipeline. The FWHM variation with wavelength follows the Î» Î± power law, where Î±Â âÂ â0.3 and is correlated with the FWHM itself. The observed behavior is much better described by von KÃ¡rmÃ¡nâs turbulence theory, with the outer-scale parameter in the range of 5â100 m, than by Kolmogorovâs turbulence theory. We also measure the temporal and angular structure functions for FWHM and compare them to simulations and results from the literature. The angular structure function saturates at scales beyond 05â10. The power spectrum of the temporal behavior is found to be broadly consistent with a damped random-walk model with a characteristic timescale in the range of âŒ5â30 minutes, though the data show a shallower high-frequency behavior. The latter is well fit by a single power law with an index in the range of â1.5 to â1.0. A hybrid model is likely needed to fully capture both the low-frequency and high-frequency behavior of the temporal variations of atmospheric seeing.}

	abstract = {Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a ground-based astronomical facility under construction, a joint project of the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, designed to conduct a multipurpose 10 yr optical survey of the Southern Hemisphere sky: the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Significant flexibility in survey strategy remains within the constraints imposed by the core science goals of probing dark energy and dark matter, cataloging the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. The surveyâs massive data throughput will be transformational for many other astrophysics domains and Rubinâs data access policy sets the stage for a huge community of potential users. To ensure that the survey science potential is maximized while serving as broad a community as possible, Rubin Observatory has involved the scientific community at large in the process of setting and refining the details of the observing strategy. The motivation, history, and decision-making process of this strategy optimization are detailed in this paper, giving context to the science-driven proposals and recommendations for the survey strategy included in this Focus Issue.}
